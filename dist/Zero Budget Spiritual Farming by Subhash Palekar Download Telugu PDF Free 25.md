## Benefits of ZBNF for Farmers and Environment
  
ZBNF has many benefits for farmers and the environment, as it reduces the dependence on external inputs and enhances the natural resources. Some of the benefits of ZBNF are:
  
- ZBNF reduces farming expenses and promotes the use of natural fertilizers and local seeds. It uses biological pesticides and plant extracts to protect crops from pests and diseases. It also avoids the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and GMOs, which can harm the soil, water, and biodiversity.
- ZBNF improves soil health and fertility by increasing organic matter and microbial activity. It also prevents soil erosion and compaction by using mulching and minimal tillage. It enhances soil aeration and water retention by avoiding intensive irrigation and deep ploughing.
- ZBNF increases crop yield and quality by improving plant growth and resilience. It also diversifies crop production by using intercropping, mixed cropping, and multi-layer cropping. It ensures food security and nutrition by providing a variety of crops for consumption and sale.
- ZBNF conserves water and energy by using 50-60% less water and electricity than conventional farming methods[^1^] [^4^]. It also reduces greenhouse gas emissions by avoiding methane production and residue burning[^1^] [^3^]. It mitigates climate change by sequestering carbon in the soil and enhancing biodiversity.

ZBNF is a sustainable and holistic approach to farming that can benefit farmers and the environment in many ways. It can also contribute to the government's goals of doubling farmers' income, promoting organic farming, and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
