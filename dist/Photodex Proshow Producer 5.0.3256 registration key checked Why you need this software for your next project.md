Photodex Proshow Producer 5.0.3256 is a powerful software for creating professional slideshows and videos. However, some users may encounter problems when trying to activate their registration key online, as the activation server is no longer available. In this article, we will show you how to bypass the activation server and use your registration key offline.
 
## Step 1: Download a proshow.ini file
 
The first step is to download a proshow.ini file from our website using the link below.

## Troubleshooting
 
If you still encounter problems with Proshow Producer, such as banners that display "Evaluation Copy" or "Use Illegally", or publishing issues, you can try the following solutions:
 
- Delete the following files found in the installation directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\Proshow\Producer): proshow.cfg and proshow.phd. They will be rebuilt when you run Proshow again.
- Publish your shows using the "For Computers" option under the Publish menu or tab. Do not select online options such as "Video for Web, Devices and Computers", "Publish Show", "YouTube", "Facebook", or other online options, as they will link to Photodex's servers, which may not have your customer data transferred, or in operation at all.
- Retrieve your registration key from the Windows registry by navigating the following path (right click on windows, run, then type regedit): HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Photodex\ProShow\license\install\25 (25 for Producer, 21 for Gold). Your registration key should be displayed under "Data".

We hope this article has helped you activate Photodex Proshow Producer 5.0.3256 without server connection. If none of these processes have resolved the situation for you, then we strongly recommend moving on to Photopia, as there is no other viable solution for a program with its developing company having been closed.
  
## What is Photopia?
 
Photopia is a new software that is designed to replace Photodex Proshow Producer and Gold. It is developed by the same team that created Proshow, and it offers many of the same features and more. Photopia is compatible with Proshow files, so you can easily import your existing projects and continue working on them. Photopia also has a modern interface, a faster performance, and a cloud service that allows you to access your shows from any device.
 
## Why should you switch to Photopia?
 
If you are a fan of Proshow, you may be wondering why you should switch to Photopia. Here are some of the reasons why Photopia is a better choice for creating slideshows and videos:

- Photopia is updated regularly with new features, bug fixes, and security patches. Proshow, on the other hand, is no longer supported by its developers and may become obsolete or incompatible with future operating systems and devices.
- Photopia has a larger and more diverse library of effects, transitions, templates, and music. You can also customize your own effects and transitions using the advanced editor. Proshow has a limited and outdated library that may not suit your needs or preferences.
- Photopia has a more intuitive and user-friendly interface that makes it easier to create and edit your shows. You can also preview your changes in real time and undo or redo any action. Proshow has a cluttered and confusing interface that may cause frustration or errors.
- Photopia has a cloud service that lets you store your shows online and access them from any device. You can also share your shows with others and collaborate on them. Proshow does not have a cloud service and requires you to save your shows locally or on external drives.

As you can see, Photopia is a superior software that offers more benefits and possibilities than Proshow. If you want to create stunning slideshows and videos with ease and convenience, you should switch to Photopia today.
