That's where Style Works 2000 Universal comes in handy. This software is a style-conversion utility that lets you take an arrangement style from a Roland, Yamaha, Korg, Ketron, General Music, Technics, or Wersi keyboard and automatically convert it to work on your keyboard.

However, Style Works 2000 Universal is not a free software. You need to purchase a license to use it fully.
