## Install the GVLK on your computer
 
To install the GVLK on your computer, you need to open an administrative command prompt and run the following command:
 `slmgr /ipk YC6KT-GKW9T-YTKYR-T4X34-R7VHC` 
This command will replace the existing product key with the GVLK and register your computer with the KMS host. You can verify that the activation was successful by running the following command:
 `slmgr /dli` 
This command will display the license information of your computer, including the activation status and the KMS host name.
 
## When to use a GVLK instead of the default product key
 
By default, computers that are running volume licensing editions of Windows Server and Windows client are already configured as KMS clients with no extra configuration needed. However, there are some scenarios where you might need to install a GVLK manually, such as:
 
- Converting a computer from using a Multiple Activation Key (MAK) to a KMS client. A MAK is a one-time activation product key that can be used to activate a fixed number of computers online or by phone. If you want to switch from using a MAK to using a KMS host, you need to install the corresponding GVLK on your computer.
- Converting a retail license of Windows to a KMS client. A retail license of Windows is a full license that can be purchased from a store or online and activated online or by phone. If you want to convert a retail license of Windows to a volume license that can be activated with a KMS host, you need to install the corresponding GVLK on your computer.
- If the computer was previously a KMS host. A KMS host is a computer that runs a service that can activate other computers on your local network. If you want to convert a computer that was previously a KMS host to a KMS client, you need to install the corresponding GVLK on your computer.
