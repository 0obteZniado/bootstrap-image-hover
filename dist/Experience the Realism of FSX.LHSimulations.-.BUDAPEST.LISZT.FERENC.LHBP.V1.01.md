FSX.LHSimulations.-.BUDAPEST.LISZT.FERENC.LHBP.V1.01 is developed by LHSimulations, a team of Hungarian flight simulation enthusiasts who have been creating sceneries for FSX since 2009. Their products are well-known for their attention to detail and realism, as well as their compatibility with other add-ons and performance optimization.
 
Budapest Liszt Ferenc International Airport (LHBP) is the largest and busiest airport in Hungary, serving as the main hub for the national carrier Wizz Air, as well as a base for Ryanair and LOT Polish Airlines. It handles over 16 million passengers and 120,000 aircraft movements per year, connecting Budapest with more than 100 destinations in Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America.
 
With FSX.LHSimulations.-.BUDAPEST.LISZT.FERENC.LHBP.V1.01, you can experience the airport in all its glory, from the modern Terminal 2A and 2B, to the old Terminal 1 (which is now closed), to the cargo and maintenance areas. You can also admire the city skyline and the Danube river from the air, as well as the nearby landmarks such as the Hungexpo exhibition center, the Ferenc PuskÃ¡s Stadium, and the SzÃ©chenyi Chain Bridge.
 
FSX.LHSimulations.-.BUDAPEST.LISZT.FERENC.LHBP.V1.01 is compatible with FSX SP2/Acceleration or Steam Edition, as well as Prepar3D v4 and v5. It requires at least 4 GB of RAM and a graphics card with 2 GB of VRAM. It is available for purchase from SimMarket for â¬19.90 (excluding VAT).
 
If you are a fan of FSX and want to explore one of the most beautiful and vibrant cities in Europe, you should definitely give FSX.LHSimulations.-.BUDAPEST.LISZT.FERENC.LHBP.V1.01 a try. You will not regret it!
  
FSX.LHSimulations.-.BUDAPEST.LISZT.FERENC.LHBP.V1.01 is not just a scenery, but also a complete package that includes several features and enhancements to make your flight simulation experience more enjoyable and realistic. Some of these features are:
 
- A high resolution photobackground covering the airport and the close vicinity of the airport, with seasonal textures and custom vegetation for all four seasons[^1^] [^2^].
- A custom light system at the whole airport, with 3D runway edge lights, taxi lights, touch down zone lights, and approach light poles. No default light system is used, which means all lights are placed where the real ones are[^1^] [^2^].
- A custom reflection map for the windows, which gives a more realistic appearance than the default one. You can also see through the windows of the SkyCourt (Main terminal, T2), which is modeled in detail[^1^] [^2^].
- "Baked" shadows on the textures, which means you can still see the shadows on the ground and on the buildings even if you switch off the shadow option in FSX. This enhances the realism and reduces the performance impact on your GPU[^1^] [^2^].
- Animated vehicles on the aprons, such as buses, trucks, and pushback tugs[^1^] [^2^].
- Animated road traffic around the airport, which adds life and movement to the scenery[^1^] [^2^].
- AES (Airport Enhancement Services) compatibility (coming soon), which will allow you to use various services and animations at the airport, such as marshalling, catering, boarding, deboarding, refueling, pushback, and more[^1^].
- All published approaches will be created in the AFCAD file, which means you can use all RNAV, ILS, VOR, NDP approaches available in the default FS GPS/GNS[^1^].

FSX.LHSimulations.-.BUDAPEST.LISZT.FERENC.LHBP.V1.01 is not only a scenery for FSX, but also for Prepar3D v4 and v5, as well as FS2004. With one purchase, you can download all versions from LHSimulations website[^3^]. You can also purchase it from SimMarket for â¬19.90 (excluding VAT)[^1^].
